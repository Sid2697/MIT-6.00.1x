# MIT-6.00.1x
This repository contains codes of Problem statements posted in course MIT 6.00.1x on edX offered by MIT
MIT 6.00.1 course offered by MIT is the introductory course for Python
It's a very well organised and challenging course
The problem statements are very nice, challenging and fun to solve
Try to solve the problems yourself and if you don't get to the solution after enough trials then refer to the manner in which I approached those problem statements.
